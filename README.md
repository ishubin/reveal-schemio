Reveal Schemio Plugin
=========================

A [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) plugin for displaying [Schemio](https://schem.io) interactive animations.
It overrides `Right` and `Space` keys on the slides with Schemio player and sends configured events to the player, which lets you trigger interactive animations inside of your Reveal presentation slide.
